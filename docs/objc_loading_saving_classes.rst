Loading & saving classes
========================

The classes described in this section are used to load and store DICOM structures
(represented by the class :cpp:class:`ImebraDataSet`).

The easiest way to load and store an :cpp:class:`ImebraDataSet` object is by using the static methods
of the :cpp:class:`ImebraCodecFactory` class.
